This sample project showcases the deployment of machine learning models using FastAPI and Streamlit. It features a web interface created with Streamlit, allowing users to input data and receive predictions from various machine-learning models. The predictions are generated by a FastAPI application that serves the machine learning models as APIs.
The project includes the following components:

app/API: This directory houses the FastAPI app and the code for each machine learning model API.
app/main.py: This file contains the startup and shutdown events for the FastAPI app.
models: In this directory, you can find the trained machine learning models stored in pickle format.
streamlit_app: This directory contains the Streamlit web interface for the project.

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Start the FastAPI app by executing the following command:
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   The API documentation can be accessed at http://localhost:8000/docs.

3. Finally, start the Streamlit app by running the following command:
   streamlit run streamlit_app/main.py

Hence, to run the project, you need to install dependencies, start the FastAPI app, and then start the Streamlit app.
